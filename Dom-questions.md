Here are some small DOM manipulation tasks to practice:

1. **Add a Paragraph:**

   - Create a new paragraph with some text and append it to a specified div.
   - Change its font size and color using JavaScript.

2. **Create a List:**

   - Create an unordered list with at least three list items.
   - Append the list to an existing container.
   - Set different background colors for each list item.

3. **Toggle Visibility:**

   - Create a button that, when clicked, hides or shows a specific div by changing its `display` style.

4. **Change Content:**

   - Select an existing heading and update its text using `innerText` or `textContent`.
   - Add a new sentence using `innerHTML` to include an additional HTML tag (like a `<strong>` tag).

5. **Add an Image:**

   - Create an image element, set its `src` attribute to an image URL, and add some `alt` text.
   - Append the image to a container and adjust its width using JavaScript.

6. **Color Picker:**

   - Create an input of type "color" and a div.
   - As the user selects different colors, change the background color of the div to the selected color.

7. **Create a Card:**

   - Build a simple "card" component programmatically with an image, a title, and a paragraph.
   - Append it to a section and adjust its styles using JavaScript.

8. **Count Clicks:**
   - Create a button that, when clicked, increments a counter displayed on the page.
   - Update the counter value each time the button is clicked.
